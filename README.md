# Linear Regression in Go

This project demonstrates how to perform linear regression in Go using the Gonum library. It includes functionalities for training a linear regression model and making predictions.
There are three datasets included, if you want to something else, you will have to edit the code. If you do this, make sure that you make the last column in the .csv the target.
## Getting Started

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. **Install Go**: Install Go (https://golang.org/dl/).

2. **Navigate to GoConsole**: Move to the directory where you added the repository
  
3. **Install Dependencies**: Install the project dependencies using Go modules: ``` go mod tidy ```
 
4. **Run the Program**: Run all files in the directory at once so that all are seen at the same time: ``` go run .```
 
5. **Follow On-Screen Instructions**: The program will prompt you to choose a CSV file containing the dataset for linear regression. Choose the appropriate CSV file from the provided options.

6. **View Results**: After selecting the CSV file, the program will train the linear regression model, make predictions, and display the results.
